The idea for `coefplot` came from Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill's masterwork [
Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://amzn.to/2j89Gsu). Whenever someone asks me how to learn statistics, that book is one of my first answers.

The coefficient plot gives a quick visual overview of a generalized linear model. A version exists in [arm](https://github.com/gelman/arm) but requires fiddling with base graphics so I made this package as the next generation.
